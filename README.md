# Veculator
University of Winnipeg Collegiate CS40S Term Project. A vector calculator programmed in swift.

## Tool Used
Xcode, swift 3.0
<br>

## Future Development
This app will probably not be on app store. A negative button needs to be added. What I have now is only a direction switching button. When I want it to be on the app store, many adjustments are needed.

### Picture
The GCD button is only added for 1st-year university courses, it will be removed later.<br>
